#Folder Description
This folder contains three files, each has their own respective datasets, where they are cleaned, analyzed, and had AI algorithms applied onto it.

#How to run
These files can be run individually, but they must have access to their respective datasets.
The files are written in Python and were made using Google Colab.

#CAP 5768 Research Paper
This program tests the different methods of data imputation on a Student Depression Dataset by applying the methods and comparing accuracies of a Logistic Regression algorithm.
The output variable for this dataset is the boolean value "Depression".
The data was first cleaned and a random amount of data was removed.
Various data imputation techniques were applied and used for prediction.
The resulting accuracies were then gathered and printed out and used as part of an external research paper.

#CAP 5768 Term Project
This program takes a Stroke Victim Dataset and both analyzes and predicts the data using different AI algorithms.
The output variable for this dataset is the boolean value "Stroke".
The program first looks for patterns in the data.
The program then attempts to predict the output using methods like Logistic Regression, DBSCAN, and K-means clustering.
The results from this program were used in an external research paper.

#CAP 6673 Dataset 2 Analysis
This program analyzes a dataset involving workplace accidents in an effort to look for possible patterns.
The output variables for this dataset are "Hositalization" and "Amputation".
The program looks at possible patterns like proportions of amputation or hospitalization based on employers, states, months, etc.
The results from this program were used in an external research paper that delved into AI in workplace injuries as a whole.
